# restaurant_rest_api_website

I created this restaurant order app to learn how to write a REST API. Currently, the app is designed to be used by waitstaff and chefs. However, this project needs additional functionality to include customer usage. 
The purpose of this project is to learn how to do full stack development using MongoDB, Node.js using npm, Express, and EJS. <br><br>Recently, I used Docker to help package all of the dependencies needed to help run the application outside of my local machine.<br><br>
Functionality I want to add:

  - billing system
  - clickable images of the menu item with the ability to customize orders 
  - user name and password 
  - cart for the items ordered
