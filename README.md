# restaurant_rest_api_website

I created this restaurant order app to learn how to write a REST API. The app is designed to be used by waitstaff and chefs. 
The purpose of this project is to learn how to do full stack development using MongoDB and Node.js with npm, Express, and EJS. <br><br>Recently, I added Docker to the program to package all of the dependencies needed to run the application outside of my local machine.

I chose to design the app to take in a typewritten response, rather than buttons, because it allows for complete customization. It also speeds up the input of the order because the waitstaff doesn't have to search for the appropriate buttons.

This is a proof of concept project for a fictitious restaurant called Snow's Diner.<br><br>
